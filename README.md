# node-keys-simulator

This is simply a fork of [node-key-sender](https://github.com/garimpeiro-it/node-key-sender) with a fix for [#25](https://github.com/garimpeiro-it/node-key-sender/issues/25).

I needed that particular problem to be fixed and the original library didn't seem to be maintained anymore.

I take abosultely no credit for the package itself or the fix, everything was already there, I just put the pieces together and made them available as a separate package.

The name has been changed to `node-keys-simulator` simply because `npm` wouldn't let me publish a package with a name like `node-key-sender-2`
